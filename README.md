# Numeric_Classification_MNIST

DIRECTIONS: ############
In order to create the necessary anaconda environment, run 

conda create -n new environment --file webcam_cnn_req.txt

PURPOSE: ###############

This project will act as a foundational reference in more complex projects. It is a naive introduction into using neural networks, even more so convolutional networks. It is also the first time I have used any computer vision tools, such as openCV. My most important goal with this project was to fully understand what was happening with each and every function call and parameter.

RESULTS: ###############

The MNIST CNN functions very well on it's own, with upwards of 99.2% accuracy on the MNIST test data set. However, it has a much lower real life percentage. When using the webcam tool, some numbers are recognized almost every time. However, some numbers are not (such as 6).
