# Numeric_Classification_MNIST

DIRECTIONS: ############
In order to create the necessary anaconda environment, run 

conda create -n new environment --file webcam_cnn_req.txt

PURPOSE: ###############

This project will act as a foundational reference in more complex projects. It is a naive introduction into using neural networks, even more so convolutional networks. It is also the first time I have used any computer vision tools, such as openCV. I used the MNIST data set as it was rather easy to work with, which allowed me to focus more on why each algorithm or function should be used.

RESULTS: ###############

The MNIST CNN functions very well on it's own, with upwards of 99.2% accuracy on the MNIST test data set. However, it has a much lower real life percentage. When using the webcam tool, some numbers are recognized almost every time. However, some numbers are not (such as 6).
