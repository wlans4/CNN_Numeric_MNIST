# Numeric_Classification_MNIST


PURPOSE: ###############

This project will act as a foundational reference in more complex projects. It is a very naive introduction into using neural networks, even more so convolutional networks. My approach was to not use any function call without doing my best to understand why the call was made, and why each parameter was used. 

RESULTS: ###############

I was able to achieve an accuracy of 99.24%
